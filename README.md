### R programs to calculate upper and lower bounds for the *r*-wise Davenport constant for finite abelian groups, using our proposed formula in the paper *Davenport constant for finite abelian groups with higher rank* (arXiv:2402.09999 [math.NT])

The *r*-wise Davenport constant of a group is the least length of a multiset over that group that ensures the existence of *r* disjoint zero-sum sub-multisets, for natural number *r*. While working on my joint paper 'Davenport constant for finite abelian groups with higher rank' (arXiv:2402.09999 [math.NT]) with Dr. Eshita Mazumdar, I used these R programs to get an idea initially how our calculated bounds for the r-wise Davenport constant were behaving as we considered more complicated and bigger group structures. We observed an asymptotic tendency, where the possible error became negligible as we were dealing with groups with larger exponents, higher rank, bigger cycle lengths and a higher *r*. Later, of course, before the preparation of this preprint and final communication, we could prove our assertion mathematically.
