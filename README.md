# d-r-bounds
While working on my joint paper 'Davenport constant for finite abelian groups with higher rank' (arXiv:2402.09999 [math.NT]) with Dr. Eshita Mazumdar, I used these R programs to get an idea initially how our calculated bounds for the r-wise Davenport constant were behaving as we considered more complicated and bigger group structures.
